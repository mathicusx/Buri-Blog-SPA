This Project was made from scratch by me. (cough.. StackOverflow).
it uses NodeJs for my BackEnd, MongoDB for my Database, and ReactJs for the FrontEnd part.

the purpose for this application is: Users can Post,Like and Comment other Users Post.
this project is work in progress as i am yet doing the css and adding more features.

How to start project:
npm start
2. run the backEnd by doing:
CD/Buri-Blog-Spa/client followed by npm start
the project is on localhost:3000 for now, I will deploy it later down the line when i implement more features.

NOTE: IN ORDER TO RUN THIS YOU NEED TO CONNECT IT TO YOUR OWN MONGODB DATABASE AS I AM NOT PUSHING THE CONFIG FOLDER TO THIS REPO
AND MAKE A SECRET KEY FOR THE JWT TOKEN
