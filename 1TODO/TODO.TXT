Some Extra Ideas 
* Email integration (forgot password, confirm account) 
* Profile View (user's can click on each others profiles and maybe "follow" them)
* Profile Edits (users can upload information about themselves: email, website, "about me", etc.) 
* Edit posts (users can delete their post, but not edit them. Add an "edit" feature.) 
* File uploads (allow users to upload images, maybe videos, etc.)
* Change the styling, make it your own
